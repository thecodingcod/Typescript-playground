So far it supports the following :
- Classes.
- Constructors.
- Functions. 
- Static members(fields,methods,constructor).
- Abstract classes & abstract methods.
- Overriding methods.
- Properties via (get and set) functions.
- Inheritance with `extends` keyword.
- public, private and protected access modifiers.
- Property Indexers
